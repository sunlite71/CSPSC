# CSPSC
My first project at the end of last century : Classic Simple Pascal Similar Compiler ( CSPSC ). Without any programming experience before, I learned Turbo C 2.0 by myself. Even do not know what Data Structure is then :-) It was for my HIT graduate thesis. Time is very tight that so I just finished it with the four-element form. Just type it as is.
